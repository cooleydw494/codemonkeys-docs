# Getting Started

[toc]

## üöÄ Installation

First, install the framework with pip:

```bash
pip install codemonkeys
```

Then, use the `monk-new` command to create a new project:

_Note: CodeMonkeys treats your project as a package, so [project_name] must be in snake_case._

```bash
monk-new [project_name]
```

`cd` into your project and run `monk` or `monk help` to test your installation.

## üìÅ Structure

CodeMonkeys' project structure aims to allow you to build/configure/run your automations in a simple, powerful way.
You're encouraged to get creative with your Automation/Command/Barrel `run()` methods, custom config properties, and
utilize any additional modules/classes/dirs you create. However, the base project scaffolding is assumed by the Monk CLI
and built-in config management. Don't fight these paradigms unless you're prepared to replace them.

| Dirs/Modules       | Summary                                                                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/commands`        | Command instances, runnable via `monk <command>`. Also handles bash/bat scripts.             |
| `/automations`     | Automation instances, runnable via `monk -a <automation>`.                                   |
| `/barrels`         | Custom or extended Barrel classes used to orchestrate multiple Automation/Monkeys.           |
| `/monkeys`         | Custom or extended Monkey classes used to precisely configure Automation behavior.           |
| `/builders`        | Custom or extended Builder classes for re-usable automation logic.                           |
| `/funcs`           | Custom or extended Func classes for GPT function-calling.                                    |
| `codemonkeys.defs` | A core module that dynamically exposes important PATHs for your project (ex: COMMANDS_PATH). |
