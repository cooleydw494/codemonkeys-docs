# Monk CLI üêµ

CodeMonkeys' CLI tool is integral to usage of the framework. The `monk` command can be run anywhere in a CodeMonkeys
project, and will always run in the context of the project root.

## Usage

The Monk CLI primarily is used to run Automations, Barrels, and framework Commands. It also makes your own `commands`
directory readily usable.

`monk` uses recursive name-matching logic to locate runnable entities. This requires unique filenames for each runnable
entity type (Commands, Automations, Barrels).

- üî∑ Entity Type flags target Automations and Barrels.
- üî∑ Action flags perform alternate operations on targetable entities.
