## Overview üåê

CodeMonkeys gives devs control over their automated GPT logic. The current focus is working on codebases but it is lovingly designed to enable automations of all kinds. This framework aims to use AI effectively, while being reliable, predictable, and tailored to your needs. There is a strong focus on only involving AI at crucial areas of strength, and using good old-fashioned code for everything else.

## Alpha Status (10-10-2023) üöß

CodeMonkeys will soon have a stable Alpha release focused on establishing the framework's architecture/concepts to a point of relative stability, and providing a flexible, immediately useful default Automation that is instructional in how it utilizes the framework.

## Medium-term Goals üìÖ
Some concerns have been set aside as I prepare for a stable Alpha release. The next major areas of focus:
- Test Coverage
- More testing on Windows/Linux (Should Work ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è)
- Handling long files (biggest limitation rn)
- Streamlined fine-tuning support
- More open-ended design
  - framework-level support for non-CLI-bases uses
  - GUI for framework (like Vue CLI UI)
- Expand pre-packaged Automations, Monkeys, Builders
  - focus on function calling support / Funcs
- Improve git workflow, contribution docs/standards
- Improve CLI output, custom Theming, accessibility
