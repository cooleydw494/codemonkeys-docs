## Is CodeMonkeys really a framework? It seems more like a tool.

I've struggled with this question myself. I've gone back and forth on whether to call it a framework or a tool. I've settled on framework because it is designed to be extended and customized. It is also designed to be used in a variety of ways. I think it is a framework that can be used as a tool via configuration alone.

## Is this your first Python project? I hate the way you've done X.

Yep, Baby's First Python project, although I've been writing code for a pretty long time. I like to think of the distinct flavor of a foreign POV in a good way, but I've also likely done some things that would offend the truly Pythonic. I'm open to suggestions and contributions. I'm also open to constructive criticism.
