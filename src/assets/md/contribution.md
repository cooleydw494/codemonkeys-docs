### Review Process

After you submit a pull request, it will be reviewed. Feedback or changes might be suggested. Keep an eye on your pull request for updates.

## üìö Contribute to the Docs

Documentation is vital for user understanding and framework adoption. To contribute:

1. Fork the [CodeMonkeys Docs repository](https://github.com/cooleydw494/codemonkeys-docs).
2. Make your changes or additions.
3. Submit a pull request.

### Understanding the Docs codebase

The CodeMonkeys Docs are a Vue app, using tailwind and SCSS for styling. All the content is written in Markdown, and content changes should **only** be made to the Markdown files in `src/assets/md`. The Markdown files are converted to HTML by markdown-it, and then rendered by Vue components. The Vue/SCSS/Tailwind code is open to changes, but please do not make changes to the Markdown at the same time, unless it is necessary for backward compatibility.
